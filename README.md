# Nerf project

This project aims to keep up with the technology known as NeRF. It involves learning various foundational knowledge in linear algebra, ML/DL, computer vision, optimization, etc., and building basic skills through several incremental small-scale projects. The final goal of this project is to build a 3D map of a university campus using one of the Large Scale NeRF techniques (e.g., Block-NeRF).
